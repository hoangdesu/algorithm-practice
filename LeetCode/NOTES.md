## Fun fact about the static block in some Leetcode solutions

The static block in your Solution class is used to execute code when the class is loaded by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). In this specific case, the static block contains a loop that calls the reverseWords method 500 times with an empty string ("") as the argument.

Why is this done?
The purpose of this static block is likely to warm up the JVM or pre-load the class before the actual Leetcode test cases are run. Here's why this might be done:

JVM Warm-up: Java applications often experience a performance boost after the JVM has "warmed up." This is because the JVM optimizes code execution (e.g., Just-In-Time compilation) after it has been run multiple times. By calling reverseWords 500 times in the static block, the method is pre-compiled and optimized by the JVM, which might reduce the runtime of the actual test cases.

Class Loading Overhead: When the class is loaded, the static block ensures that the reverseWords method is already in memory and ready to execute. This can reduce the overhead of class loading and method initialization during the actual test case execution.

Leetcode Timing: Leetcode measures the runtime of your solution, and sometimes small optimizations like this can lead to faster execution times, especially for solutions that are already efficient.

Is this necessary?
No, this is not necessary for the correctness of the solution. It is more of a hack to potentially improve the runtime on Leetcode's platform. In real-world applications, such optimizations are rarely needed unless you are dealing with extremely performance-sensitive code.

Key Points:
The static block runs when the class is loaded, before any instance of the class is created or any static method is called.

The loop in the static block is not part of the actual solution logic; it is just a performance optimization trick.

This approach is specific to competitive programming platforms like Leetcode and is not a general best practice for Java development.

If you remove the static block, the solution will still work correctly, but it might have a slightly higher runtime on Leetcode due to the lack of JVM warm-up.

For example:
```
class Solution {
    static {
        for (int i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
            reverseWords("");
        }
    }

    public static String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            String word = words[i];
            if (!word.isEmpty()) {
                sb.append(word);

                if (i != 0) sb.append(" ");
            }
        }

        return sb.toString().trim();
    }
}
```

-> putting the static block here reducing the running time from 5ms to 2ms :O
